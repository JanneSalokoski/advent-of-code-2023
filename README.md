# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) and
some tooling to help me ~~solve the problems faster~~ not get annoyed with the
setup everyday.

## day-&ast;.py

The solution for both parts of the days problem. Or the attempts if I don't
finish the puzzle.

## lib.py

Helper library. Contains methods for reading the input or sample from file
and measuring performance.

## new_day.py, load_input.py and edit.sh

You run `new_day.py` when you start solving. It loads the input, creates the
files and even opens up nvim with the files opened.

## template.py

Includes the template for the days solution file.
